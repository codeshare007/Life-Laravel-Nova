In the past, addiction was thought to be a weakness of character, but research is now proving that addiction is a matter of brain chemistry. Addictions that center on ingested substances (e.g. drugs or alcohol) change body chemistry; addictions to activities or behaviors cause the body to produce extra endorphins and other chemicals that make a person feel good temporarily. Either way, changes in body chemistry create a dependency on the activity or substance. Because they are chemical in nature, essential oils can assist recovering addicts with emotional and chemical support for the brain as they are seeking to get their lives under control again.","usage_tip":"Aromatic: Choose an oil(s) to diffuse or inhale from a bottle or hands, or whatever method seems most effective at the time. Wear an oil(s) as perfume\/cologne.Topical: Apply under nose, behind ears, to base of skull (especially in suboccipitial triangles) and forehead, and on roof of mouth (closest location to the amygdala; place on pad of thumb, then suck on thumb); place oil that is best match to emotional state over heart area. Use a carrier oil as needed for sensitive skin or \u201chot\u201d oils. Use to prevent and eliminate urges.Internal: For immediate impact, in addition to inhalation, place a drop or two of chosen oil under tongue, hold for 30 seconds, swallow; take oils in capsule or in glass of water.

Aromatic: use of oils at bedtime with a diffuser or smelling oils from some kind of sealed container during school can bring both peace and calming, also mental focus and concentration support. Oils supply a vast variety of emotional support. Topical: use of oils with children is most effective when oils are combined with a carrier oil and are massaged on back, abdomen or feet (neat - undiluted - application on feet with 1-2 drops depending on body weight is acceptable in older children; for infants and toddlers, dilute oils with a carrier oil prior to application in most cases).","views_count":0,"comments_count":0,"oils":[{"resource_type":"Solution","id":85,"solution_id":39,"solution_type":"Oil","name":"Lavender","description":"Most used essential oil for children; all things calming.","views_count":0},{"resource_type":"Solution","id":86,"solution_id":65,"solution_type":"Oil","name":"Wild Orange","description":"Gentle\/powerful calming\/uplifting; digestive support; boost immune\/anti-infectious; promotes sense of abundance \u201cthere is enough for me!

Pregnant women must take steps to remain as healthy and well nourished as they possibly can. Labor is a process by which the baby inside the womb adjusts itself to its surroundings and passes out of the uterus to be born. Breastfeeding is the normal way of providing young infants the nutrients they need for healthy growth and development. Essential oils can assist with some of the uncomfortable changes that take place in a woman\u2019s body during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum periods as well as during breastfeeding. Oils may be used for breast soreness, constipation, depression, fatigue, high blood pressure, nausea, sleep, stretch marks, swelling, and more.","usage_tip":"Use truly therapeutic, superior grade essential oils that are certified as pure, potent, genuine and authentic and subjected to rigorous testing to ensure no harmful ingredients are present. Many products on the market contain synthetic components\/ingredients and are to be avoided altogether. Be aware. When using pure and potent oils, be aware of what they might do before using them. When using more powerful oils, use small amounts and dilute with a carrier oil. Be a wise steward. The first three months are the time baby develops rapidly. Simply be more cautious during the first trimester.Pay attention to how the body responds to dosages. As body weight increases, there may be a need to increase dosage accordingly. OR use less due to heightened sensitivity. Once again, pay attention to the body\u2019s responses. Consider using oils diluted (especially if particularly strong or \u201chot\u201d) as a habit during pregnancy versus using them NEAT (undiluted). The bottoms of the feet are an excellent conservative application location (commonly used with children). Another option is to do a patch test if concerned. Simply apply a single drop on skin and observe results prior to use.Use oils aromatically as a safe method during pregnancy. They are excellent for boosting mood and energy and creating an uplifting environment. The also support stress and tension reduction and promote a good night\u2019s sleep.Consider the source. When it comes to trying to decipher facts regarding essential oil use during pregnancy and nursing, human studies are not conducted. Rather animal studies, mainly on rats, are the source of the majority of information. During these studies inordinately high doses of essential oils are injected at levels that exceed human consumption and fail to duplicate the human experience. Frankly, no human would consume or use these quantities nor do they inject them as a form of use. Err on the side of safety. In conclusion, use prudence, dilute, and avoid anything that simply doesn\u2019t feel right. Some oils will be better diluted such as the \u201chot\u201d oils listed in the usage section located earlier in this book.

Most individuals are in a constant state of dehydration, which takes its toll on overall health, but particularly kidney health. In addition to adequate water intake, there are some essential oils that are effective in supporting kidney health and helping the body to rid itself of UTI discomfort and infections. While it is of utmost importance to utilize the services of medical professionals in the case of a prolonged or serious condition, essential oils can serve as a powerful first line of defense.","usage_tip":"Internal: Use softgels or place drops of oil(s) in a capsule and consume every few hours for acute situations; or under tongue or in water.Topical: Place over urinary areas of bladder\/kidneys.

The most common causes of weight gain are from excessive eating and poor nutrition. Other factors may be medication, inactivity, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, or slow metabolisms. Being overweight can bring about undesirable emotional effects such as depression, anxiety, and mood swings. Excess weight or obesity can cause exhaustion or fatigue and challenge an individual's quality of life. Carrying excess fat can also dramatically increase the risk of developing deadly and debilitating diseases. Essential oils and whole-food supplementation can be powerful allies in the process of maintaining a healthy weight and losing excess weight.","usage_tip":"For weight management, the focus is primarily on what and how much food is consumed (appetite) and how well it is utilized as fuel by the body (metabolism). Additionally, balancing other processes such as elimination, blood sugar, and hormones is often necessary for long-lasting results. See suggested programs in \u201cRemedies\u201d below. With that in mind: Internal: Ingesting oils for support with appetite, cravings and metabolism, including the ability to burn fat and release it along with toxins is very effective. Place drops of oils in a capsule for systemic or on-going support. Drink oils in water; drop on tongue. Be generous with usage for this purpose.Topical: Use to assist the body to detox and target specific zones. Consider applying blends of oils to areas like the abdomen, thighs, and arms as a treatment. Use a carrier oil if necessary to prevent sensitivity especially with oils like cinnamon.

Add 1 tablespoon kefir grains to 8-16 ounces of raw milk, place in a jar with a lid.
